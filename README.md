The application we have created is called Blah Nutrients, and our purpse is to help our users easily gain access to nutritional information and make informed decisions about their food choices. Health-conscious consumers typically experience confusion and frustration when searching for accurate information surrounding their dietary needs. Conflicting information on platforms like Instagram, Youtube, and TikTok often overshadows verified research that’s too technical for the average user. As a result, existing sources are scattered, inconsistent, and misleading, making it difficult for individuals—especially those with specific dietary needs—to make informed choices. Our API, powered by Open Food Facts, provides detailed information about various foods and products, including allergen information, dietary restrictions, and nutritional scores, in order to help users make more informed decisions about their dietary choices. By consolidating and simplifying this information, our API aims to bridge the gap between scientific research and everyday users, ensuring that individuals have access to reliable and accurate data when making food-related decisions. With our platform, users can easily filter and search for products that align with their dietary needs and preferences, ultimately promoting better health and well-being for all. Additionally, users can also view the Eco Score, which rates the environmental impact of the food they consume. With Blah Nutrients, users can make healthier and more sustainable choices when it comes to their diet and overall lifestyle. 
Our app is currently supported by Chrome, firefox, and Safari. We also support operating systems such as iOS and Android. With our wide range of supported platforms, users can access Blah Nutrients on their preferred device, making it simple to make informed decisions about their diet and lifestyle no matter where they are or what device they are using.
